# AI-based-maritime-safety-system-for-fisherman-from-crossing-international-maritime-boundary
Accidental crossing of international maritime boundaries is a recurring issue faced by Indian fishermen, often resulting in arrests, economic loss, and even fatalities. Existing systems such as GPS-based alerts are largely reactive and lack predictive capability, while advanced solutions like AIS or satellite tracking are costly and power-intensive, making them unsuitable for small-scale fishing vessels.To address this gap, we propose a low-cost, AI-powered Maritime Safety System that integrates GPS for positioning, GIS for boundary mapping, GSM for SMS-based alerts, and Machine Learning models for prediction. The system classifies vessels into Safe, Caution, and Danger zones and estimates time-to-crossing using regression models. Proactive alerts are delivered through buzzer, LED, and GSM SMS, ensuring that fishermen receive timely warnings even without internet connectivity. This approach enhances safety, reduces cross-border incidents, and supports sustainable fishing livelihoods.
